# INTRODUCTION
An significant part of a person's body is their face, which is particularly useful for interpreting
their behaviour and emotional condition. Without realising it, we categorise emotions
frequently. Without uttering a word, the human face is capable of expressing a wide range of
emotions. And unlike certain nonverbal communication techniques, these expressions can
recognized by all types of individuals and are universal. The most significant use of emotion
detection is in facial expression. The topic of emotion recognition is now the subject of much
research. Techniques for detecting mood using facial images yield results quickly and
effectively. Since the period of Aristotle, the ability to recognise emotional state in facial
expression has been a fascinating topic. After 1960, when a catalogue of universal emotions was
created and many systems were suggested, this idea gained greater traction. Our expectations
have increased since the advent of contemporary technology, which has no bounds.
People from all cultures around the globe all use the same facial expressions and body languages 
for joy, sorrow, anger, surprised, anxiety, and contempt. People who watch you can tell how 
you're feeling by the way your muscles move. In addition to many other primates and certain 
other animal species, they are the way by which societal information can be shared between 
humans. Humans may express themselves facially voluntarily or unintentionally. People often
produce involuntary expressions when they are unwell, injured, or uncomfortable. In social 
interaction, facial expressions of emotions play a significant role in understanding others' 
motives. Researcher took notice of that as well since about the capacity to recognise facial 
expressions aids in human-computer interaction, helps advertisers create effective
advertisements, and improves human communication process by modifying emotional 
intelligence (EQ) in people. On a daily basis, people can usually identify emotions by the 
distinctive qualities they present as part of a facial expression. For instance, a smiles or its 
upward movement of the lips' corner are certainly signs which indicate satisfaction. Similar to 
how one emotion can be distinguished from another by additional deformations unique to that
emotion. The questions revolves around the presentation and classification of either dynamic or 
static properties so all the formations and deformations of face pigments are addressed in
research on the automated identification of facial expressions. One of the primary 
informational streams in interpersonal interaction is facial expressions. Because of the
applications across perceptual and cognitive sciences, it is only natural that face emotion
research which had grabbed a lot of attention during the past decade..
With the fast advancement of Artificial Intelligent (AI) capabilities, interest in automated Facial
Emotion Recognition (FER) has indeed been rising recently.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the evolving landscape of human-computer interaction, understanding and 
responding to human emotions play a crucial role in creating more intuitive and empathetic 
systems. Emotion detection technology aims to enhance user experiences by enabling machines 
to recognize and respond to the emotional states of users. However, there are several challenges 
that need to be addressed to achieve accurate and reliable emotion detection.
This field of face recognition deals with tactics and approaches for reading facial expressions
for emotions. The identification of emotions has become simpler because to several technical
advancements in the area of artificial intelligency and machine learnings. Expressions are
anticipated to become the next communication tool for computers. Automated facial analysis of 
emotions is becoming increasingly necessary. The majority of the studies in this field focuses 
on extracting emotional responses from movies or audio data. The majority of these studies work 
matches and recognises faces, however deep convolutional neural networks havenot been 
utilised to extract emotions from photos. 
Facial Emotion Recognition is a field of study that seeks to extract an emotion from a person's
facial expression. According to the polls, improvements in emotion detection have simplified
complicated systems. There are several uses for FER, which will be covered later. The difficult
problem of emotion recognition arises from the fact that emotions might differ based on the
situation, one's appearance, culture, and facial expression, which produces confusing data.
Understanding facial expression recognition is greatly aided by a survey on the subject.
Approach can be said as a machine learning that uses data models created specifically to do a
certain task. In the fields of image identification, classification, selection, pattern matching, etc.,
deep learning in neural network models has many applications. For selecting features,
picture recognition, and other deep learning applications, multi - modal deep learning is
utilised.
