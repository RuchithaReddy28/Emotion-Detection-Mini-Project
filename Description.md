# Introduction
An significant part of a person's body is their face, which is particularly useful for interpreting
their behaviour and emotional condition. Without realising it, we categorise emotions
frequently. Without uttering a word, the human face is capable of expressing a wide range of
emotions. And unlike certain nonverbal communication techniques, these expressions can
recognized by all types of individuals and are universal. The most significant use of emotion
detection is in facial expression. The topic of emotion recognition is now the subject of much
research. Techniques for detecting mood using facial images yield results quickly and
effectively. Since the period of Aristotle, the ability to recognise emotional state in facial
expression has been a fascinating topic. After 1960, when a catalogue of universal emotions was
created and many systems were suggested, this idea gained greater traction. Our expectations
have increased since the advent of contemporary technology, which has no bounds.
People from all cultures around the globe all use the same facial expressions and body languages 
for joy, sorrow, anger, surprised, anxiety, and contempt. People who watch you can tell how 
you're feeling by the way your muscles move. In addition to many other primates and certain 
other animal species, they are the way by which societal information can be shared between 
humans. Humans may express themselves facially voluntarily or unintentionally. People often
produce involuntary expressions when they are unwell, injured, or uncomfortable. In social 
interaction, facial expressions of emotions play a significant role in understanding others' 
motives. Researcher took notice of that as well since about the capacity to recognise facial 
expressions aids in human-computer interaction, helps advertisers create effective
advertisements, and improves human communication process by modifying emotional 
intelligence (EQ) in people. On a daily basis, people can usually identify emotions by the 
distinctive qualities they present as part of a facial expression. For instance, a smiles or its 
upward movement of the lips' corner are certainly signs which indicate satisfaction. Similar to 
how one emotion can be distinguished from another by additional deformations unique to that
emotion. The questions revolves around the presentation and classification of either dynamic or 
static properties so all the formations and deformations of face pigments are addressed in
research on the automated identification of facial expressions. One of the primary 
informational streams in interpersonal interaction is facial expressions. Because of the
applications across perceptual and cognitive sciences, it is only natural that face emotion
research which had grabbed a lot of attention during the past decade..
With the fast advancement of Artificial Intelligent (AI) capabilities, interest in automated Facial
Emotion Recognition (FER) has indeed been rising recently.
