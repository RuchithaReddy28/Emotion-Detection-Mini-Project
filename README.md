# Emotion-Detection-Mini-Project
### Abstract
Emotion detection is a crucial component in the field of human-computer interaction and sentiment analysis. This project aims to develop a robust and accurate emotion detection system by leveraging deep learning techniques. We utilize a comprehensive dataset of facial expressions and voice recordings to train a multimodal model capable of recognizing a range of human emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear ,depression and more. The Mini Xception classifier is used to classify these facial traits. For gender classification simple CNN (convolutional neural network) is used. The fusion of these modalities enhance the systemâ€™s overall performance. Our system is tested on various real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential in applications such as mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and human-computer interaction. The results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in emotion detection, showcasing the potential for widespread adoption in diverse industries.
